                            Project has been started from product definition phase which goal was to get to know the sense of createing the solution. This concept is the basis for final product. The phase includes an interview with shop owner. <br>
                            The interview includes five thematic blocks: <br><br>

                            <h5>Project background</h5>
                            The service activity of the "WALDI" company was started in 2006 and was carried out on nearby marketplaces. The shop in shopping mall was opned in 2013.<br>
                            Shop "WALDI" is located in Revia Park Shopping Mall in Zamość. In average month shop is visited by about 300 independent people and most of the visits aren't more frequent than once a month. The shopping mall is located on the outskirts of the city and is not a very popular place.<br>
                            Revia Park is fully opened 9:00 am, but the "WALDI" service point due to having one cash register and conducting business also at marketplaces, officially opens at 1:00 p.m. and closes at 8:00 p.m.. Work at marketplaces depends on many factors, for example the weather, so in case of resignation from work at marketplace the shop is opened earlier. The work in the bazaars also causes a lot of exhaustion - therefore, after returning from work, the owner needs a two-hour break, in events of illness or for other private reasons the shop is run by the owner's spouse or one of his sons, who are not familiar with the implementation of all available services at "WALDI" shop. <br>
                            Work in the markerplaces, causes that the services can be provided also in: Józefów, Łaszczów, Tyszowce and Zakrzówek.<br>
                            The owner stated that that there are two main problems that he faces in his work: one of them is the inability to implement some services ordered by clients (this applies to the lack of a suitable machine) and the other specified by the owner as follows: "Clients sometimes come with services that my sons and wife are unable to do, things such as coding the immobilizer or repairing the watch, the clients often leave the shop and don't come back." - this generally applies to things that customers can't leave at the shop -- like the only key to the car or they live far away from the shopping mall and coming back later won't pay off.<br><br>

                            Due to the limitations of face to face contacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the activities that were carried out during the project include exploratory surveys among current customers of the "WALDI" service point and the observation of service provided in the shop.
                            <h5>Exploratory Surveys</h5>
                                The survey consists of 17 questions and it's goals are to get to know: <br>
                                - customer motivation to use the service point, <br>
                                - customer communication needs, <br>
                                - effective ways to advertise the company. <br><br>
                                <h6>Motivation</h6>
                                The "WALDI" service point can be found via website of shopping mall Revia Park, or via Google Maps. However, inferring from customers' statements few of them gets to the shop, using above solutions. The most of the people came to the shop for the first time, because they were passing by (38.1%) or thanks to a friend (33.3%).

                                - getting to know that the service they came with can't be provided at this time or can't be provided at all,<br>
                                - waiting.<br><br>

                                <h6>Possibility to contact with "WALDI" Shop</h6>

                                The website as a solution is to meet both the needs of the customers and the owner. The clients will be able to check the necessary information on operation and capabilities, as well as the possibility of viewing (with the option to purchase) clocks that are for sale at the "WALDI" service point. The owner will have possibility to update informations on the website (after logging in).

                            The website has been divided into nine sections. The sections called "the owner is / is not currently in the Revia Park Gallery" and the "basket of products" will be accessible from anywhere on the website.<br>
                            During the development of the information architecture, one of the ideas was to implement the possibility of booking time for the service, but due to the way the company works, it wouldn't be possible. People waiting in the queue can't be served after the customer who appeared at the shop a moment ago - there is a high probability that customers from the queue would resign from providing services at the "WALDI" service point, also people who don't use internet would be aggrieved.
                            <br>
                            Initially, the owner did't want to disclose the prices of the services due to competition, but because of the benefits presented in connection with their availability (the prices are attractive to customers), he changed his mind.
                            <br>

                            "WALDI" Company provides many different services, therefore, if all services were on one page it could be problematic to find the service. The "Implemented services" subpage allows users to find the price (or price range), instructions, hours in which the service can be provided and the time needed for it's implementation after going through maximally three questions narrowing the scope of services in the circle of User's interests. Online sales carried out by a service company is limited to the sale of old mechanical clocks. Online trading with all products would force a number of changes in the company, which at the moment is not possible.<br>

                            The possibility of logging in will only include the owner's account, that's why there is no registration option.<br>

                            Tasks should last about 15 minutes, hence their number. The test tasks concerned the main functionalities that are available on the website. The tasks in which it was possible have context - the users could imagine themselves in the given situation. The tasks were structured the way that doesn't suggest answers to users and not to be incomprehensible to them.<br><br>
                            <h4>User testing - Clients</h4>
                            The testing among potential customers of service shop "WALDI" included five respondents who varied in age and gender. Each person participating in the test was between the ages of twenty and forty five (because the solution is addressed to such respondents). Presented below conclusions are the results of testing.<br><br>
                            <b>First task: Browse the site for 10-15 seconds and answer the question - What does "WALDI" company do?</b><br>
                            The users were able to find out what the page was about within 10-15 seconds. These were general information about the offer of the "WALDI" company. Tests participants reported the services they observed on the home page: making keys, repairing clocks / watches, sharpening tools. The respondents didn't talk about the assortment for sell.
                            <div style="text-align: center;">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit-2x" src="assets/images/praca-licencjacka-Test1PrzegladanieStrony.png">
                            </div><br><br>
                            <b>Task two: You are on tour and you would like to find out if:<br>
                            a) the shop in shopping mall is opened? <br>
                            b) you will be able to make a copy of car key in the Revia Park Shopping Mall now? It's Thursday 15:30.</b><br>
                            During this task, users didn't see the banner at the top of the homepage that said "Owner is currently available at the shop", but most of them noticed the "Work schedule" button located on the right side of banner and used it to check if the shop is opened.
                            <div style="text-align: center;">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit-05x" src="assets/images/praca-licencjacka-test2Baner.png">
                            </div><br><br>
                            <b>Task three: You work near the Revia Park Shopping Mall. You have half hour break and in the meantime, you would like to buy rechargeable batteries. <br>
                            a) check whether on Thursday between 2:15 pm and 2:30 p.m. the shop will be opened, <br>
                            b) check whether "WALDI" sells rechargeable batteries.</b><br>
                            The content of point a) was very similar to the content of the first task, therefore problems didn't appear during this task. In point b the range of assortment for sell was unclear i.e. users could find information about the services provided on the homepage, but they couldn't see the assortment for sell - that's why they had to use menu placed in the right corner of the navbar.<br><br>
                            <b>Task four: Next week you go to your uncle's birthday party and you know that he is a fan of mechanical clocks. Try to buy Adler's "Mechanical Pendulum Clock" from 2015 without logging in and by filling in the appropriate fields as follows:<br>
                                a) Payment method: payment in advance. <br>
                                b) Delivery method - courier. <br>
                                c) Method of fiscalisation: invoice. <br>
                                d) Payment method: bank transfer. <br>
                                e) Bank: choose any.</b><br> <br>
                            During the fourth task, one of the respondents had a problem with finding the button leading to the subpage where he could buy a clock. He started his search from the subpage "Range of sold products", not "Clocks for sale".<br><br>
                            <b>Task five: You have a mechanical clock at home that you would like to repair.
                            You don't know what is wrong with it. See if the "WALDI" company is able to help you in such a case.</b><br>
                            This task posed no problems to the study participants.<br><br>
                            <b>Task six: You have a large number of sieves and knives for a grinding machine, you know the price of the competitor and you want to see at what price you can get this service in "WALDI" company.<br>
                                a) Check the price of the above service.<br>
                                b) Send an e-mail to lower the found price. </b><br>
                            This task posed no problems to the study participants.<br><br>
                            <b>Task seven: You live in Józefów and you would like to get a copy of key to your car.<br>
                                a.1) Check if the "WALDI" company operates in Józefów,<br>
                                a.2) if so, check where you can find them.<br>
                                b) Check if the attendant in Józefów will be able to perform this service.</b><br>
                            At the beginning, each of the tests participants searched for information about the "WALDI" company's location in the "About company" subpage. People who started looking for it in "Work Schedule" weren't sure if they are at the right page, they didn't read the description at the top of the page and information about the marketplaces is under the work schedule of service point at Revia Park Shopping Mall.<br>

                            The tests, carried out with the owner of the shop, covered five tasks and concerned the available functionalities in the control panel. The tasks were tested on a prototype in mobile and computer version. In both cases, the first task was to log into the control panel.<br>

                            <b>
                                - Task one: You are currently at the shop and suddenly you have to close it, change the settings to "Shop closed"<br><br>
                                - Tast two: Try to add a new service to the system.<br><br>
                                - Taskt three: You know that on Tuesday you will be working at the shop from 1:00 pm. Enter the change in the system. <br><br>

                                b) set the next picture as the main picture,<br>
                                c) undo made changes. <br>
                            </b>
                            During testing, the owner encountered a problem in undoing changes made on the website. The icon representing the button wasn't associated with activity history by him.

                        The solution was designed in figma. The website design was implemented in two variants: one for the phone screen - 375x815 pixels, it's the screen size of the iPhone 11 Pro and the other one for the screen of a computer browser in the size of 1350x698 pixels corresponding to the size of browser windows on the computer that was used for testing the solution. The designed mock-ups were inspired by the Material Design system. The website is designed in a flat design style. The project was implemented in the Mobile First approach. <br><br>
                        <h3>Colors</h3>

                        Violet color (#4E3189) is a color that contrasts with both the background color and the companies colors - therefore it is the main color used for interactions on the page. Pink (#EE3D55) was used to interact on white (#FFFFFF), or gray (#F4F0ED) backgroud and was used for secondary interactions, e.g. to remove items from the shopping basket.

                        Text written on a white or gray background appeared in black (#000000) color and text written on a different color background is in white color. The website background color is gray while the white color was used as background color of the sections, because of the difference between gray and white, individual sections can be distinguished from each other. Muted companies colors were also used as background colors, for: the navigation bar, footer, shop section and the contact section. Muted colors of the company along with the emerging wave refer to the characteristic elements of the company's advertising banners. The colors have been muted, because they are used as elements of background and it shouldn't focus users attention.<br><br>
