                                    prototype was built on the basis of the User Experience Design process. The process consists of
                                    5 stages: Product Definition, Research, Analysis, Prototype Building and Testing. The design
                                    work was started from an interview with the owner of the shop, who also participated in further
                                    work on the project. The project paid special attention to the needs of users, which were examined at the initial stage of design during research stage. On the basis of the resulting conclusions
                                    from collected data the prototype has been designed. Created solution was tested by potential
                                    users and updated until the tests were successfully completed by all participants.

                            The shopping mall is fully opened 9:00 am, but the "WALDI" service point due to having one cash register and conducting business also at marketplaces, officially opens at 1:00 p.m. and closes at 8:00 p.m.. Work at marketplaces depends on many factors, such as the weather, so sometimes the shop is opened from 9:00 a.m.. <br>
                            Departures to the marketplaces are characterized by the need to start work at 5 a.m. -- therefore, after returning from work, the owner needs a two-hour break, also in the event of illness or for other private reasons, the shop is run by the spouse owner, or one of his sons, who cannot provide all services provided at the "WALDI" service point. Work in the markerplaces, causes that the services can be provided also in: Józefów, Łaszczów, Tyszowce and Zakrzówek.<br>
                            The owner, when asked about the problems he faces on a daily basis at work, stated that that there are basically two main problems, one of them is the inability to implement some services ordered by clients (this applies to the lack of a suitable machine) and the other specified by the owner as follows: "Clients sometimes come with services that my sons and wife are unable to do, things such as coding the immobilizer or repairing the watch, the clients often leave the shop and do not come back. " - this generally applies to things that customers can't leave at the shop -- like the only key to the car or they live far away from the shopping mall and it won't pay off.<br><br>

                            <h5>Aim of the project</h5> 
                            The owner of the service point is not familiar with the possibilities offered by the Internet for his company. He would like the website to meet the needs of customers, advertise the service point and improve communication with customers.    <br><br>      
                            
                            <h5>Target group</h5>
                            The target group for the solution are people who are from 20 to 45 years old, because according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://stat.gov.pl/en/topics/science-and-technology/information-society/information-society-in-poland-in-2020,1,7.html">GUS's research  (Central Statistical Office)</a> these are the people who use the internet the most ofte -- 95% of people living in Poland in age from 16 to 45 use internet, older ones use internet less often. As the company provides locksmith services the target group has been narrowed down to age range starting from 20 years old.<br><br>

                        <h5>Competition</h5>
                        Competition for "WALDI" company is located around Zamość, as the service point provides different services, the comptetition has been devided into three groups:<br>
                        - watchmakers, <br>
                        - locksmiths, <br>
                        - trade. <br><br>

                        <h5>Project scope</h5>
                        At this phase of work on the project, expectations for the solution are general. <br>
                        Owner stated that:<br>
                        - there must be "the scope of provided services, the saled ware and the hourly work schedule"<br>
                        - there may be a "system for communication with the clients and old clocks for sale”.

                        The purpose of the research phase is to find out about real or potential needs and problems of clients that have an impact on their choices and behavior. Tools used to achieve these goals are: empathy maps, ethnographic interviews, user observations, exploratory surveys, analysis of the environment and needs in the context of functionality. Due to the limitations of face to face contacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,
                        the activities that were carried out during the project include exploratory surveys among current customers of the "WALDI" service point and the observation of service providing in the shop.
                        <h5>Exploratory Surveys</h5>
                            The survey consists of 17 questions. The goals of survey are to get to know: <br>
                            - customer motivation to use the service point, <br>
                            - customer communication needs, <br>
                            - effective ways to advertise the company. <br>
                            <h6>Motivation</h6>
                            The "WALDI" service point can be found via website of shopping mall  Revia Park, or via Google Maps. However, inferring from customers' statements few of them gets to the shop, because of the above solutions: 
                            <div class="panel-body" style="text-align: center;">
                                <a target="_blank">
                                    <img class="nk-img-fit architektura" src="assets/images/praca-licencjacka-WykresKolowySkadDowiedziałasSieO-eng.svg">

                            </div>
                            Most people came to the shop for the first time, because they were passing by (38.1%) or thanks to a friend (33.3%). Looking at the indicated level of satisfaction with the services provided in the shop "WALDI" it can also be stated that the customers are satisfied with the provided services. 
                            <div class="panel-body" style="text-align: center;">
                                <a target="_blank">

                            </div>
                            The motivation that made the respondents of the survey and people being in the shop during observation use the services from "WALDI" shop are:<br>
                            - an apartment close to the shopping mall Revia Park,<br>
                            - friendly relations,<br>
                            - honesty,<br>
                            - well-performed services,<br>
                            - good prices.<br><br>

                            <h6>The scope of provided services</h6>      
                            The answers provided in the survey indicate that clients don't know the entire scope of the realized services provided by the company "WALDI". This may be due to the lack of need in provoding these services, but at the time when such a service will be needed customers still won't know that they can do it there.<br><br>   
                            <h6>Information provided about provided service</h6> 
                            Some of the respondents indicated the reasons why they are not "very satisfied" with the provided informations about the provided services: <br>
                            - knowing the price of the service only after its completion, <br>
                            - getting to know that the service they came with can't be provided at this time or can't be provided at all,<br>
                            - waiting.<br><br>

                            <h6>Possibility to contact with "WALDI" Shop</h6>
                            There are two ways to contact the "WALDI" service point, this is physical contact in the shop or telephone contact. The phone isn't always answered on the first contact attempt and sometimes due to poor coverage in the shopping mall missed calls arrive much later than they should, therefore some of the respondents pointed to problems with the possibility of contacting the service company "WALDI".<br><br>

                            <h6>Considering "WALDI" Shop as the best choice in respondents case</h6>
                            Most of the respondents were determined to recognize the "WALDI" service shop as the best choice in their case, because:<br>
                            - the point has an appropriate location,<br>
                            - the owner of the point is honest, <br>
                            - customers have not encountered better prices, <br>
                            - customers had a problem with competing companies. <br><br>

                            <h6>Additional remarks</h6>
                            In this part of the survey, the respondents expressed their will to have information on whether the owner is currently in the service shop and a greater range of possibilities of contacting the shop.<br><br>
                            
                            <h6>Comment to the survey</h6>
                            The surveys were distributed among the current customers of service shop. The questionnaire was available both on paper and in the form of a link on a sheet of paper (with the code QR).

                            The website as a solution is to meet both the needs of the customers and the owner. The user will be able to check the necessary information on operation and capabilities, as well as the possibility of viewing (with the option to purchase) clocks that are for sale at the "WALDI" service point. The owner will have possibility to update informations on the website (after logging in).

                        The website has been devided into nine subpages. The sections called "The owner is / is not currently in the Revia Park Gallery" and the "basket of products" will be accessible from any subpage of the website.<br>
                        During the development of the information architecture, one of the ideas was to implement the possibility of booking time for the service, but due to the way the company works, it would n't be possible. People waiting in the queue can't be served after the customer who appeared at the shop a moment ago - there is a high probability that customers from the queue would resign from providing services at the "WALDI" service point, in addition in such a case, people who don't use internet would be aggrieved.
                        <br>
                        Initially, the owner did't want to disclose the prices of the services due to competition, but because of the benefits presented in connection with their availability (the prices are attractive to customers), he changed his mind.<br>

                        The number of possible services at "WALDI" company is large, therefore, if
                        all services were on one page it could bewould be problematic to find the service. The "Implemented Services" subpage allows users to find out the price (or price range), instructions, hours in which the service can be provided and the time needed for it's implementation after going through a maximum of three questions narrowing the scope of services in the circle
                        of User's interests. Online sales carried out by a service company
                        is limited to the sale of old mechanical clocks. Online Trading
                        with the remaining goods would force a number of changes in the company, which at the moment is not possible.<br>

                        The possibility of logging in will include only the owner's account, that's why the registration option wasn't presented in the information architecture.<br>

                        The number of tasks results from the time in which the users are able to perform them, i.e. in about 15 minutes.The test tasks concerned the main functionalities that end users can use. The tasks in which it was possible had context - the user could imagine himself in a given situation, thus undertaken activities could be closer to the situation in everyday life. The tasks were structured the way that doesn't suggest answers to users, and to not be incomprehensible to them.<br><br>
                        <h4>User testing - Clients</h4>
                        The test among potential customers of service shop "WALDI"  included five respondents who varied in terms of age and gender. Each person participating in the test was between the ages of twenty and forty five, because the solution is addressed to such respondents. Usability tests revealed problems that potential users of the solutions had. Presented below conclusions are the results of testing.<br><br>
                        <b>First task: Browse the site for 10-15 seconds and answer the question - What does "WALDI" company do?</b><br>
                        The users were able to find out what the page was about within 10-15 seconds. These were general information about the offer of the "WALDI" company. Tests participants
                        reported the services they observed on the home page: making keys, repairing clocks / watches, sharpening. The respondents didn't talk about the assortment for sell.
                        <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <img class="nk-img-fit-2x" src="assets/images/praca-licencjacka-Test1PrzegladanieStrony.png">
                        </div><br><br>
                        <b>Task two: You are on tour and you would like to find out:<br>
                        a) Is the shop in shopping mall opened? <br>
                        b) Will you be able to make a copy of car key in the Revia Park shopping mall now? It is Thursday 15:30.</b><br>
                        During this task, users didn't see the banner at the top of the home page that said "Owner is currently available at the shop", but most of them noticed the "Work schedule" button located on the right side of banner and used it to check if the shop was opened.
                        <div style="text-align: center;">
                            <img class="nk-img-fit-05x" src="assets/images/praca-licencjacka-test2Baner.png">
                        </div><br><br>
                        <b>Task three: You work near the Revia Park Shopping mall. You have a half hour break and in the meantime, you would like to buy rechargeable batteries. <br>
                        a) check whether on Thursday between 2:15 pm and 2:30 pm the shop will be open, <br>
                        b) check whether "WALDI" sells rechargeable batteries.</b><br>
                        The content of point a was very similar to the content of the first task, therefore problems didn't appear during this task. In point b the range of assortment for sell was unclear i.e. users could find information about the services provided on the home page, but they couldn't see the assortment for sell - that's why they had to use menu placed in the right corner of the nav bar.<br><br>
                        <b>Task four: Next week you go to your uncle's birthday party and you know that he is a fan of mechanical clocks. Try to buy Adler's "Mechanical Pendulum Clock" from 2015 without logging in and by filling in the appropriate fields as follows:<br>
                            a) Payment method: payment in advance. <br>
                            b) Delivery method - courier. <br>
                            c) Method of fiscalisation: invoice. <br>
                            d) Payment method: bank transfer. <br>
                            e) Bank: choose any.</b><br> <br>
                        During the fourth task, one of the respondents had a problem with finding the button
                        leading to the subpage where he can buy a clock. He started his search from the subpage "Range of sold goods", not "Clocks for sale".<br><br>
                        <b>Task five: You have a mechanical clock at home that you would like to repair.
                        You don't know what's wrong. See if the "WALDI" company is able to help you with such case.</b><br>
                        This task posed no problems to the study participants.<br><br>
                        <b>Task six: You have a large number of sieves and knives for a grinding machine, you know the price of the competitor and you want to see at what price you can get this service in "WALDI" company.<br>
                            a) Check the price of the above service.<br>
                            b) Send an e-mail to lower the found price. </b><br>
                        This task posed no problems to the study participants.<br><br>
                        <b>Task seven: You live in Józefów and you would like to get a copy of key to your car.<br>
                            a.1) Check if the "WALDI" company operates in Józefów,<br>
                            a.2) if so, check where you can find them.<br>
                            b) Check if the attendant in Józefów will be able to perform this service.</b><br>
                        At the beginning, each of the tests participants searched for information about the "WALDI" company's location in the "About company" subpage. People who started looking for in "Work Schedule"weren't sure if they are at the right page, they didn't read the description at the top of the page + information about marketplaces is under the work schedule of Revia Park shopping mall.<br>

                        The participants didn't know where they could find information about availability of the service, which could be found after clicking the information button.

                        The tests, carried out with the owner of the shop, covered five tasks and concerned the available functionalities in the control panel. The tasks were tested on a prototype in mobile and computer version. In both cases, the first task was to log into the control panel.<br>

                        <b>
                            - Task one: You are currently at the shop and suddenly you have to close it, change the settings to "Shop closed"<br><br>

                        During testing, the owner encountered a problem in undoing changes made on the website. The icon representing the button wasn't associated with activity history.

                        The solution was designed in figma. The website design was implemented in two variants: one for the phone screen - 375x815 pixels corresponding to the screen size of the iPhone 11 Pro and the other for the screen of a computer browser in the size of 1350x698 pixels corresponding to the size of full-size browser windows on the computer that was used for testing solutions. The designed mock-ups were inspired by the Material Design system. The website is designed in a flat design style. The project was implemented in the Mobile First approach. <br><br>
                        <h3>Colors</h3>
                        The colors of the page have been adapted to the colors used by the service facility
                        "WALDI". The colors correspond to the colors used for the company's advertising banners.<br><br>

Color pink (#EE3D55) was used to interact on white (#FFFFFF), or gray (# F4F0ED) backgroud and served for secondary interactions, e.g. to remove items from the shopping basket.

                        Text written on a white (#FFFFFF) or gray (#F4F0ED) background appeared in black (#000000) color and text written on a different color background is in white (#FFFFFF) color. The background color of the project is gray (#F4F0ED) while the white color (#FFFFFF) was used as background color of the section on the website, because of the difference between gray (#F4F0ED) and white (#FFFFFF), you can distinguish individual sections from each other. Muted companie's colors were also used as background colors, for: the navigation bar, footer, shop section and the contact section. Muted colors of the company along with the emerging wave refer to the characteristic elements of the company's advertising banners. The colors have been muted because they are used as elements of the background and shouldn't focus users attention.<br><br>
