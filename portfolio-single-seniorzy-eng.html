                                    The presented project was created for an internship competition.
                                    The task is: "Create a product that will support the elderly during a pandemic." 
                                    - based on research, conversations and observations, I have created a product that 
                                    should potentially help elderly people with the problems they struggle with. 
                                    The solution affects not only the problems that arose during the pandemic, 
                                    but those that were also before, but appeared much more in contrast during the 
                                    lock-down.

                            <h4>Research:</h4> <br>
                            <h5>Social needs of the 60+ age group (generally):</h5>

                            Just like other social groups, seniors also need contact with people around them. People they can talk to, cuddle with, important to them. The main social needs that were observed on the basis of 14 studies were:<br>
                            - variety of needs - different needs resulting from culture, personality, ...<br>
                            - the need for closeness - due to the age, the circle of friends of the elderly is reduced to a smaller number of people, inter alia, by retirement, less frequent "partying".<br>
                            - need for meaningful relationships - meaningful / active relationships with friends / family / neighbors, and even with strangers. Being able to talk to people, interact, show affection affects their well-being and helps them stay independent. <br>
                            - the need for reciprocity - in addition to receiving support from others, they also want to be able to show support to people. <br><br>
                            In the 60+ age group, 51% of respondents saw a decline in well-being due to concerns such as:<br>
                            - fear of the future - 70%<br>
                            - feeling of loneliness and stress - 54%<br>
                            - being bored 43%<br><br>
                            How did people aged 60+ cope with quarantine?<br>
                            - being in touch with the family<br>
                            - reading books<br>
                            - gardening<br><br>
                            <h5>The needs and desires of the elderly resulting from conversations, observations:</h5>
                            - Physical activity (walking) - the elderly are aware of the need for physical activity and know that its lack has a negative impact on their health. (96.3% of surveyed Poles aged 60+ admit that regular physical activity is of great or very great importance to health). <br>
                            - Face-to-face conversations - having contact with people who live alone, I heard comments in the style of "this phone and phone all the time", which indicated an excess of communication with friends and family using electronic devices. <br>
                            (96% of seniors believe that social activity is very important for health, such as regular meetings with friends, involvement in various initiatives, participation in events, etc.)<br>
                            - The need to shop - due to being in the group of people with an increased risk of disease and reduced physical fitness, the elderly during quarantine needed someone who could go to the store for them.<br>
                            The need to use your time in a meaningful way - due to the lack of activities and an excess of thinking about things that are happening around an elderly person, they cause more frequent irritation with distant things, those that are beyond your control and can cause health problems.<br>
                            Summary of research, interviews and observations: <br>
                            - Older people have social needs just like young people. They require more attention and understanding, due to the reduced group of friends at their age, each acquaintance, interaction is more important to them, so the need for a relationship with each close person with an elderly person is greater. <br>
                            - Older people need physical activity and are aware of its impact on health.<br>
                            - Elderly people need things that they can do on a daily basis in order to make good use of their time. <br>
                            - Quarantine had a greater impact on the elderly in terms of the relational aspect and the aspect of physical activity.<br>
                            - Elderly people during quarantine needed more support when shopping or other activities requiring strength, longer movement or leaving the house.<br><br>
                            <h4>Persona:</h4>
                            <h5>Mrs. Grażyna during the pandemic:</h5>
                            - 70 years old<br>
                            - Her husband died a few years ago, so she lives in her apartment alone.<br>
                            - She has spent all her life near her hometown.<br>
                            - The family went all over Poland a long time ago.<br>
                            - The relations she has with her neighbors from the tenement house - she meets them for talks, he also attends the senior club. Due to the pandemic, the meetings stopped (in both cases). Now the neighbors, instead of meeting each other, call each other and spend much more time on the phone.<br>
                            - Physical activities: Nordic walking with friends.<br>
                            - She likes watching TV, cooking, going for walks, talking to people, reading books.<br>
                            - He has health problems - he has to take medication at certain times.<br>
                            - The family visits her relatively rarely because she lives far away - she is visited by someone from her family approximately every 2 weeks. Due to the pandemic, the only contact with my grandmother is the virtual, telephone one.<br>
                            - Going shopping for Mrs. Grażyna is also problematic - she is not able to carry too much, so if she is to do the shopping herself, she must do it quite often<br>
                            - What is she afraid of?<br>
                                - that he will catch the virus (due to age)<br>
                                - that there will be no one to help her when something happens<br>
                            - What's missing?<br>
                                - face-to-face contact<br>
                                - support with daily activities<br>
                                - something to do, to use your time in a meaningful way<br><br>
                            
                            <h3>Defining the problem:</h3>
                            After gaining knowledge about the target audience in the project, I would like to focus on the well-being of the elderly - clearly, the decline in well-being was noticeable among the respondents when asked about the quarantine time. The problem of well-being is largely related to the feeling of uncertainty about the future, feeling lonely and feeling helpless. In my project I will try to focus on improving these aspects of older people's lives. <br>
                            <h4 class="text-xs-center">Problem: How to increase the well-being of older people during a pandemic?</h4>
                            <h3>Generating ideas:</h3>
                            <h4>Brainstorm:</h4>
                            - A button attached to any phone that allows you to call any phone number.<br>
                            - An intuitive portal that allows elderly people to interact with each other via the Internet.<br>
                            - A TV program that allows training for the elderly at regular times (using the media they use most often)<br>
                            - TV adapter reminding you to take medication, allowing for phone calls and other communicators (using a webcam)<br>
                            - A scanner mounted in front of the door that allows you to check the temperature of a person entering it - reducing the risk of illness. A disinfector that effectively disinfects every person entering the house / A suit that allows family members to visit an elderly person 100% safely, with the possibility of a hug, with the required visor.<br>
                            - A mini plot for a balcony with a guide - allowing not only to grow flowers, but also vegetables.<br>
                            - An application that allows the elderly to spend their time efficiently - someone living nearby posts an advertisement for sewing a sweater, cooking cabbage rolls, dumplings, ..., then the senior could accept such an application, the person would bring the necessary ingredients, and then for a certain amount of money would receive the ready dish .<br>
                            <h4>Selection of Ideas:</h4>
                            Among the ideas that arose during the brainstorm, I chose those that were the most appropriate in terms of aspects important for the project, aspects that I took into account:<br>
                            - Ease of implementation - an indicator indicating the complexity and problematic nature of introducing the solution to reality.<br>
                            - Product price attractiveness - products free of charge for users were immediately reevaluated to the highest rating, while products requiring costs were scaled based on the real amount that the product would require after completion - the cost estimate based on the components needed and production costs<br>
                            - The impact of the product on the well-being of the elderly - This aspect relates strictly to the question about the value of the problem being solved - how much the product can affect the well-being of the elderly.<br>
                            - Product shelf life - this mainly applies to the long-term use of the product - if the product would be useful only for a certain period of time - e.g. a quarantine product has a poor rating in this respect.<br>
                            - Product usability by elderly people - here I took into account the barriers in the use of new technologies, mainly smartphones, creating applications for mobile devices and solutions related to this type of technology.<br>
                            Of course, there are many more aspects that can be taken into account, but the ones mentioned above I found the most appropriate because of getting to know the group during the empathization process. The values ​​in the table were scaled between 1 and 5, where 1 was the least appropriate aspect value for the project, and 5 was the greatest value.<br>
                            <div class="center-aligement">
                                <iframe class="excel" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQuuU4vrcPhXE59Is2tf0DN9QDj9VOjDZhDQhy7DpviJ7eTV4sFi6nlnX7Hs84XS4vCKcJCb6o4nf4t/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" ></iframe>
                            </div>
                            From the analysis, 3 out of 7 ideas stood out much higher than the others - reaching over 20 points. Out of the 3 solutions, 1 is very simple to implement, is sold at low prices or is made by the self-realization of those interested. So there are only 2 solutions that can be easily combined into one meaningful whole.<br>
                            <h3>Proposed solution:</h3>
                            The solution that I will deal with in the next part of the project is a TV set combining the possibility of making calls via communicators or a telephone with the use of video-conversation, reminding about medicines, birthdays or any other important events. In addition to the snap-in, the product would contain a button to be used in emergencies such as fainting, heart problems or other things that require emergency intervention.<br>
                            <h4>Why such a solution?</h4>
                            “As much as 90 percent watch TV every day. people over 65 years of age. Of this group, just over a third do it for more than 4 hours a day. " - the vast majority of people use a TV, have a TV, and are not afraid of it.<br>
                            The solution concerns an adapter which, instead of requiring the purchase of new equipment (e.g. a TV with a smartTV), would allow you to use any device with a screen.<br>
                            The button is designed to affect the sense of security and resourcefulness in the event of a crisis, which at the same time has a positive impact on the well-being of a person.<br>
                            <h3>Users scenarios:</h3>
                            1) Mrs. Alina is 86 years old. Her immune system is weak, and any flu could cause serious harm. Mrs. Alina lives alone. Due to the pandemic, he is afraid to step out of his apartment. She has a lot of girlfriends and can't wait to see them again. For a long time, she only used the phone, and also that she would have an accident - that she would fall over, or she would collapse and there would be no one to help her. Ms. Alina recently bought a TV set - Everyday Senior Helper, which takes away the fear that has accompanied her for a long time. Ms. Alina always keeps the remote control with her. That evening, Mrs. Alina fell over the threshold in the entrance to the room, breaking her hip at the same time. She couldn't move, she was in panic and needed urgent intervention. She pressed the accident button, which automatically connected her to her daughter. The daughter showed up after 15 minutes, and so did the ambulance service she called before she left for her mother. <br>
                            2) Mr. Jan lives alone. He is 80 years old and a lot of time because he is retired. His wife died 10 years ago, and only the dog lives in the apartment. Mr. Jan has recently sprained his ankle and he has no way of taking the dog out, and he does not want to let him out alone because he is afraid for his health, he could run into a car, there is no one to do it for him. Along with this problem, another one is born - ie shopping. Any departure of Mr. John from the house costs him a lot of effort. Mr. Jan does not know how to use a computer, and he does not even have one, he only has a TV set and an old cell phone, so looking for support is additionally difficult.<br>
                            Fortunately, Mr. Jan invested in a TV set-top box some time ago - Everyday Senior Helper, which allows him to ask all volunteers in the area for help. After 10 minutes, a 13-year-old boy shows up with a vacation and a lot of free time, and going out with the dog and shoppingto żaden problem.<br>
                            3) Mr. Arnold is 68 years old and lives with his family in a two-generation home. Unfortunately, his wife passed away two years ago, and Mr. Arnold doesn't have many friends in the area - he recently moved to his daughter because he didn't want to live alone. It is true that he now lives with his grandchildren, daughter and son-in-law, but they are all overworked and rarely a Senior Helper has set a filter for people close to 5 kilometers, over 65 years of age and thanks to the new device, he has new friends every day with whom he can arrange a coffee , a walk or a game of chess.<br>

                            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
                            I created a prototype of the program interface and a visualization of the product set. The interface is to present the proposed functions and show potential user interactions with the device. The prototype is at the middle fidelity level. It contains functional functions, but not everything is clickable, the appearance of the presented prototype is also not final. The whole thing is just an image that in the process of creating a product would be refined at the next stages of creation. I tried to take into account the value of the product and the potential of the proposed solution.<br>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-1.gif">
                            </div>
                            <h4>The product would include:</h4>
                            - snap-in for any screen<br>
                            - webcam<br>
                            - remote<br>
                            <h4>Basic features:</h4>
                            - ringing<br>
                            - seeking support<br>
                            - to meet new people<br>
                            - the ability to call quickly in an emergency<br>
                            - drinking reminders for dates and activities (e.g. taking medication, friends' birthdays)<br>
                            <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-architektura.png">
                            </div>
                            <h4>Remote controller:</h4>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-3.png">
                            </div>
                            While watching TV there is a possibility to use al features of remote controller by clicking the right buttons - it's because the project has been prepared for elders - I tried to make it as simple as possible. Except navigation, buttons, there is a scroll button which makes it possible to change the size of font in the application - based on  tests with elder product users that I found during research - most of them if they had a pissiblity to change the font size - they enlarged it much more than is assumed as sufficient.<br>
                            <h4>Calling:</h4>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-4.png">
                            </div>
                            Calling is side feature and that's why choosing the contact that user want to call takes 3 steps. Calling would be possible because of bluetooth or by putting SIM card inside it.<br>
                            <h4>Meeting:</h4>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-5.png">
                            </div>
                            Meeting - feature that enables 2 elder people depending on preferences to talk and make new friends. The whole process requires interaction of 2 people because one gives proposition and the other has to respond for it. All right propositions for user would be placed in their notifications so that they could easly answer them.<br>
                            <h4>Accident</h4>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-6.gif">
                            </div>
                            The process actually consists of only 1 step - in the absence of confirmation, the application will automatically make a call to the indicated phone number. This feature will be useful in the event of a need for quick intervention in the event of an accident, fainting, or a seizure. Older people have problems using the phone, this function is intended to give them a greater sense of security. In my mind, I did not want to put an ambulance number under the number in the event of an accident due to the risk of making a phone call accidentally, unknowingly - although such functionality is not excluded.<br>
                            <h4>Help:</h4>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-7.gif">
                            </div>
                            Help - an elderly user by clicking this button declares the need for help and such information lands on mobile applications declared to support volunteers. It can be about shopping, cleaning the apartment, throwing out the trash or walking the dog. I thought of it as any kind of voluntary service, but this type of service could also be paid due to the possibility of little interest on the part of young people in taking up such an initiative.<br>
                            <h4>Reminders:</h4>
                            <div class="text-xs-center">
                                <img class="nk-img-fit" width="50%" src="assets/images/seniorzy-prototyping-8.gif">
                            </div>
                            Both notifications and reminders appear on the right side of the screen. He can open it with details in full screen by clicking the green receiver or the ok button. As for birthday notifications - within the application you can call your friend and send him wishes. In the case of important notifications, such as taking medication, the notification would not appear on a part of the screen, but immediately in a version with details on the entire screen. You can go to notifications, reminders, plans from the application menu.<br>
