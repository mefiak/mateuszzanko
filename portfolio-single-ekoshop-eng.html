                                        The project has been started in a team of three. Our request was to make a presentation of work with client based on proposed changes on their website. We chose the website by ourselves having website topic and sham mail from our customer. The main purpose of redesign was to make increase conversion. As convesion can be understood in different ways we asked what does it mean for our "client" - as we expected it meant to make more clients make shopping on page.
                                        The biggest competitor for our "client" was  <a href = "https://minimal.com.pl">https://minimal.com.pl</a> that sells 10-12% more than them. Other pages that "client" gave us as his inspiration are:<br>
                                        <a href = "https://www.rajapack.co.uk/paper_vs_plastic.html">https://www.rajapack.co.uk/paper_vs_plastic.html</a><br>
                                        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/paidpost/allbirds/the-view-from-above.html ">https://www.nytimes.com/paidpost/allbirds/the-view-from-above.html</a><br>
                                        <a href="https://drinkeverandever.com">https://drinkeverandever.com</a><br>
                                        Our aim was mostly around young people interested in ecology.
                                        So we knew the purpose of redesign and shops that owner sees as inspiration and competition. 
                                        Durign project we made tests with users, benchmark, owner site audit and then started to work on changes. 
                                        The project by it's own didn't expect from as full redesign of website - just propositions of changes and possible sketches that will be used during 30 minutes presentation of our work.
                                        I've decided to go a little further and made a prototype expanding work that have been made during project itself. It's still not a full redesign of website - I made it to show my skills and thinking process expanding my portfolio. <br>

                                We've redesigned Main Menu, because as you can see on picture above the one that is on the page is more than 2 times longer than computer screen size. <br>
                                During tests with users we asked them about the difference they sees between: "super food", "healthy food" and "(company name) delicatessen" - the answers to this question didn't reflect content of these subcategories.<br>
                                Based on benchmark through propositions given by "Client" and some research on the internet, knowing that they have many categories as team we decided to cut categories that can be put together and from all of possibilities we made 3 main categories: <br>
                                - "Delikatesy" (Delicatessen) - is all about food. <br>
                                - "Drogeria" (Drugstore) - is all about cosmetics.<br>
                                - "Dietetyk Online" (Online Dietitian) - it didn't fit to any above categories.<br>
                                Second thing that I've made is adeed main menu if the page is scrolled up (it isn't working perfectly in prototype, but it shows the idea). This menu navigation bar is shown without advertisement because then it would take a lot of screen space - it would be annoying for users.
                                The redesign of Main Menu has been shown in

                                <h4>Contrast:</h4>
                                    Text on website seemed to be really bright while appearing on white background so it was really hard to read something longer than few words. 
                                    So we've made contrast tests for different colors appearing on website
                                    (Explanation: WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders). WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text.):<br><br>
                                    <h6>#D3B896</h6>
                                    This color has been used for headers of different categories above products. 
                                    As you can see in "Before Redesign Link" they are hard to notice while going through page.

                                    <h6>#A96842</h6>
                                    This color is used to write most of the text on the website. As you can see it doesn't pass the test for longer texts and font size below 18pt.
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">

                                    <h6>#FCO165</h6>
                                    This color is used only for highlighting text or hovering feedback on clickable elements. It passes the first level test so we decided to leave it as it is.

                                    This color passes all of the tests and appears as part of the website. We decided to swipe the color of headers for this so all #D3B896 elements were changed for #713F00.

                                    <h6>#70430B</h6>
                                    This color appears as the one with the best contrast level above all on the website, it passes all the tests - so we decided to make it a color for all texts that appeard beyond headers as we used #713F00 over there. So the change is #A96842 to #70430B.

                                    With font color changes I've made changes on other elements to make then fit to the rest of the page and make them more visible.

                                    Durign tests one of the user searching for a product didn't realise that he scrolled too far during searching and started to look for product from category in propositions like "Last Watched", "Popular", "Others looked for these too" he realised that it's not what he was looking for after few seconds.
                                    As you can see in

                                    , the whole page had #FFFFFF (white) background - parts of the layout that weren't conncted all appeared without sepperation. So I changed a color of background as a bright grey - just to make a difference of color appiring as background of page and sections -

                                    <h6>3.</h6>
                                    The layout of items in categories and items on the left and under categories all were the same size - so it wasn't hard to dismiss the difference between kinds of products. The layout of products under the main section has been changed and appears as smaller with added arrow to swipe them right and left. Products on the left side appears as bigger to distinguish them. <br><br>
                                    <h6>4.</h6>
                                    Small numbers that for many shows the end of main content of website during scrolling can be dismissed. It's a really small change, but can make a difference for user during searching - I enlarged the size of these numbers. <br><br>
                                <h4>Other things in Navbar</h4>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">

                                    <h6>#changewith(brandname)</h6>
                                    Users asked during project where do they think it would move them were thinking mostly about Social Media (instagram, youtube videos), but no one said it could move them to blog - as it appears on the page. As you can see under this part of page there is another link to blog (different one) - it puts confusion on users.
                                    Based on users feedback I've decided to leave one linke to blog in main manu and filled white space with advertisement that appeard on the end of website (as not many goes that far down).<br><br>
                                    <h6>Sign in, Sign up, Basket, Currency </h6>
                                    Sign In and Sign Up are mostly placed in top-right corner and that is where I've put them.<br>
                                    On website Currency and Language Toggle have been placed with Sign in and Sign up options. I think that has been made to show shape of butterfly, but: <br>
                                    - page doesn't give possibility to change language from Polish (it's unclickable).
                                    - Currency does not have much in common with registration or signing in and it have a lot more common with basket.
                                    That's why I've deleted Language Toggle and I've put Currency next to basket.
                                    Basket appeard in 2 seperate elements next to each other - it hadn't been shown during tests, but in my  opinion as it is one basket and amount of elements inside of it - it should appear as one - and that's how I showed it. <br><br>
                                <h4>Filters</h4>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                                        <img width="30%" src="assets/images/ekoshop-9.JPG">
                                    </div><br><br>
                                    At first impression I didn't realise that those are filters for searched products.
                                    As team we searched solutions that are common for users. Inspirated by Allegro.pl we changed it for the one on the right side.<br><br>
                                <h4>Categories</h4>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                                        <img width="30%" src="assets/images/ekoshop-10.JPG">
                                    </div><br><br>
                                    As you can see on the left old categories were always filled with all of possibilites. If user clicked one of categories we suppose that he want's to find something inside of it - so we show him what kinds of subcategories he or she can choose inside of one that he've been already interested about. <br>
                                    If user wants to choose different one he can make it by using main manu which is available from Navigation Bar on every page.<br>
                                    The other reason for such a choice is that it have to be above filters - it tells user where he is right now and because of longer list of categories if user wants to use filter he will have to scroll longer.<br><br>
                                <h4>Basket Pop-up</h4>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                                        <img class="nk-img-fit"  src="assets/images/ekoshop-11.JPG">
                                    </div><br><br>
                                    If user puts something in the basket the basket window shows up. As you can see above even though I put 5 items in basket there is still just 1 item shown in pop-uping window. That could make some of users confused and discouraged - because the browser remembers items that have been put there even month or more before. Users could simply forget about that and later on they can feel being cheated and never come back to the website. Under item that is inside of the basket you can see advertisements of other items from the shop - as this window is made for users to see what did by clicking "Add to basket" button they can't really focus or even see it clearly.<br>
                                    During tests one of the tasks was to add 3 different items to the basket. The button that allows user to come back from the pop-up basket window is nearly being fully transparent. Users even though they don't want to stop shopping at this moment were pushed to do it and had to focus and think to find the button on the left that they searched for.<br>
                                    Third thing that I saw was hard to change is amount of items added to the list and possility to delete something that user wants to change for different item.<br>
                                    My proposition for this pop-uping window is to make clear and easy for user to see what he have already added to his basket. So I've deleted  advertisements and I've added possibility to scroll through whole basket without searching for right button to see basket page. I've changed the color of button allowing users to come back to the previos viewed page (making it easier for them to continue shopping). As the last thing I've added possibility to change amount of items by plus and minus buttons. <br><br>
                                <h4>Product Page</h4>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;">
                                        <img class="nk-img-fit"  src="assets/images/ekoshop-12.JPG">
                                    </div><br><br>
                                    If someone came that far, he probably went this way: User comes to the page, searches for product, clicks on the product from the list - that person must be interested in this item. So our request is to make the clearest way to buy that thing as we can only imagine, without not required distractors. <br>
                                    During tests one of the users Didn't know for what reasone he have categories on the left - he felt this  page overcrowded and annoying. <br>
                                    My proposition is to take off elements that can distract, annoy, makes bad experience for user from this page. So I've hide categories that we are in and advertisements that shows up on the sides.<br>
                                    I've also changed the descritpion of product to make it stick to let side and I've left all of possible advertisements under informations about items.<br><br>
                                <h4>2 more small changes</h4>
                                    <h6>Social Media</h6>
                                    Because of really good and qualitative Social Media I've decided to make them more visible - so as we read in Poland from left to right I've just left it on left side of the screen instead of right.<br>
                                    Of course it's not the best, only possible solution that makes Social Media 10 times more popular than right now, but it's a thing that doesn't require a huge work input and it helps so it's worth doing.<br><br>
                                    <h6>Navigation colors</h6>
                                    If user goes into a category it's getting pink in Main Menu. It's another small thing, maybe oversight, but for sure if it have a possitive impact, why not add it?
